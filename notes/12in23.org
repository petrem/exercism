* Year-long badge exercises

:COMMENTS:
Languages column lists language "earned" when done, or available languages from started
trackes where not done, paranthesised.

Where exercises where done previous to this year in a started track, track is not
available so need to choose from other tracks:
:END:

:NOT-AVAILABLES:
- March: potentially could use C++ or Rust
- April: problematic, only Julia and R are available :(
- July: Could use C++
- August: not sure; let's see if there is no intersection with some iteresting language
  in October; otherwise, elm? typescript? kotlin?

* Feedback

** The good
- Created excitement, kept engines running
- Maintained interest with nice month groupings
- Worked well with intro videos
- Made me finally read (and partially skim-through) an Erlang book, I was interested to
  get a general idea of the language and OTP platform for a long time.
- Kept me a bit more involved in the comunity (eye-sight range; still not in hearing
  range, or, preffered deity forbid, smelling range).
  - Thus I learned of the financial situation which I would have ignored otherwise, and
    donated (not bragging, but I really think I woldn't have otherwise).
  - I've also started to request some mentoring here and there, and I think this made me
    less afraid of becoming a mentor, which I'm really glad I did.
- 

** The bad
- For me, because I have to tick all the gamification boxes, I think it prevented me
  from getting more in-depth with just a few languages. For example, I want to learn
  Rust, but I know I have to dedicate it significant time. Hence, left it for later
  (see ‡).
- Where I had year-long exercises resolved in previous years, I had to start tracks I
  really didn't want to continue (see ‡).

Note ‡: not Exercism's fault, I just describe the result on me :)

** The ugly

- Must put something here for the fun at least.
